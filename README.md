# Flutter AirAsia Flight Checker

A simple window program to check for the cheapest AirAsia flights within the selected date range in a click.
Because who wants to sit there and screen through every single page?

####  TODO List in priority order
1. Display user readable data for the response returned from API
2. Fix Location Autocomplete Display (To display proper info)
3. Add date picker for date input field
4. Add cache/cookie for user's selections
5. Related to point 5, allow user to switch between their previous selections
6. Add price range filter
7. Add currency dropdown selection (Probably will just fix it to MYR, I make this for my own usage anyway)
